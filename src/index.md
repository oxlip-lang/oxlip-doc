This is the documentation for the __Oxlip API Language__.

Oxlip is a high-level functional programming language for designing [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/what-is-openapi) definitions.
As an [Interface Description Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language), it is not general purpose.
The motivation is to alleviate the pain of managing OpenAPI in JSON or YAML by hand and at scale.
Oxlip defines algebraic abstractions over [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) concepts, not too dissimilar to [Sass/SCSS over CSS](https://sass-lang.com/).

There are pros and cons to both _API-design-first_ and OpenAPI generated from implementation.
As OpenAPI is better produced or consumed by machines rather than humans, Oxlip tries to help _API-design-first_ teams with better tooling.
