This is the documentation for the Oxlip API Language (a.k.a OAL).

OAL is a high-level functional programming language for designing OpenAPI definitions.
As an [Interface Description Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language), it is not general purpose.
The motivation is to alleviate the pain of managing OpenAPI in JSON or YAML by hand.
OAL defines algebraic abstractions over REST concepts, not too dissimilar to [Sass/SCSS over CSS](https://sass-lang.com/).

OpenAPI is the assembly language of REST API design and is better produced or consumed by machines than humans.
