# Capabilities

To address the challenges of handwriting OpenAPI definitions at scale, OAL offers three main capabilities:

- __modular__: project structure can be organized freely into folders and modules.
- __composable__: REST concepts are mapped to types and operations, enabling the composition of low-level values (e.g. JSON properties) into higher-level entities (e.g. HTTP end-points) as language expressions.
- __functional__: behavior can be encapsulated in functions and reused at will.

OAL also enhances OpenAPI with support for [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS), even if this capability is still experimental.
