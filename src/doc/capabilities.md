# Capabilities

To address the challenges of handwriting OpenAPI and managing large definitions across multiple teams, Oxlip offers the following capabilities:

- __human readable__: statement-based language to help with readability (e.g. for code reviews);
- __declarative__: as with bare OpenAPI in either JSON or YAML. Not a general purpose language;
- __modular__: project structure can be organized freely into folders and modules;
- __composable__: REST concepts are mapped to types and operators, enabling the composition of low-level values (e.g. JSON properties) into higher-level entities (e.g. HTTP end-points) as language expressions;
- __functional__: behavior can be encapsulated in functions, generalized and reused at will.

Oxlip also enhances OpenAPI with experimental support for [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS).
