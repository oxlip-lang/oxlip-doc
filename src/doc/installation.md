# Installation

{: .note }
Installation requires a [local Rust and Cargo installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

Checkout the code from the [Git repository](https://github.com/oxlip-lang/oal) and run:

```
cargo install --path oal-client
```

A [VSCode language extension](https://github.com/oxlip-lang/oal-vscode) is also available for syntax highlighting and IDE integration.
